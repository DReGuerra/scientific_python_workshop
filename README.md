Description: \
This repository contains a scientific computing workshop focusing on Python programming language. This workshop includes (some) Python basics, data handling techniques using the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) package, data analysis with [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/), and plotting with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). The majority of the content is based on my own experience with Python, and so it is not exhaustive. I started the workshop with some of the more popular and useful packages. I will continue to add new sections to this workshop, eventually some more advanced ones such as object oriented programming (OOP) with python.

*NOTE:* If you would like to contribute to the core body of the workshop, please contact me and I will add you as a contributor.

## Contents
1. Python basics
2. Scientific computing
3. Visualization techniques

## Overview
This repository will be actively developed for new content. Its core structure is laid out below: \
`1_data/` $\rightarrow$ raw data files (usually .csv)\
`2_proc_data/` $\rightarrow$ processed data files (usually .csv) \
`3_output/` $\rightarrow$ output data (mostly .csv) \
`4_figures/` $\rightarrow$ figures produced by the script (.png, .eps, etc.)

In the main directory of the repository you will find interactive python notebooks (.ipynb) which are executable and a great way to learn and develop python code. The benefit of the interactive notebooks is the readability with in-line outputs, as well as the ease of de-bugging. Additionally, you will find some sample python scripts (.py).
